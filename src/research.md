### Cognitive Robotics + Dialog Systems
- Development of a **Memory Storage System** for the robot [*Indy*](https://grp.riken.jp/en/news/20250514/#indy) at RIKEN Guardian Robot Project. This memory system is built using concepts from *Cognitive Psychology*, particularly research on memory decay or *"forgetting"*, along with systems that store, adjust, and summarize past experiences in natural language with the aid of  *Large-Language Models*.
- Development of a **Dialogue System** that incorporates the robot's stored memories by retrieving past experiences that match the current dialogue context and incorporate it in the robot's spoken responses.
- Technical support for *Automatic Speech Recognition* and other modules.

#### Research Grants
- 2023-2024, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology - JAPAN, KAKEN, Start-Up, "Development of Long-Term Memory for Companion Robot" 

### Doctoral Dissertation
- Development of *Constraint-solving Methods* to Solve Dynamical Systems using *Interval Arithmetic* Computations that ensure reliable results. In particular, we focused on developing methods that improved the computation time while minimizing the accuracy loss in the estimated numerical system.
